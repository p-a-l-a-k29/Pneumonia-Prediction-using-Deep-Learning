# Pneumonia-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
Deep Learning model built using vgg16(transfer learning model).Gives high accuracy.
Dataset downloaded from kaggle has images of scanned chest x-ray(train and test and validation images) both of NORMAL and PNEUMONIA patients.
The prediction model is the training model and the Final classification is to check if the prediction model is correct or not.We input two images one of NORMAL chest X-ray and the other of PNEUMONIA chest x-ray both gives accurate results.
